v-bind:attribute = "Expression"
This is a way to map javascript to our html compoonents - say we have a vue component such as a checkbox, we want the checked property to depend on the isDone props -> so we would bind that property to in our .vue component file
and in app vue if we wanted to pass it we would say that v-bind:isChecked = "True"

V-for
acts like a for loop to display to display a list of things 
>This is applied to elements like other attinutes
>v-for = "item in items" this attatches to the element that we want to repeat and then renders that element and its children 
>App Case:
*Display an Li element for every to-do item inside our ToDoItems array, we then want to pass the data from each to do item to a ToDoitem component


v-on 
Used for event handling - we want our submit even in form to call our custom onSubmit method 
syntax
v-on:event = "method" or @event = "method"


v-model
binds to the data property you set on it and keeps it in sync 
with input
syntax:
v-model = "variable"
